# Sanpo Kenjū

All this Minecraft Mod does is add in the Zanpakutō, Sanpo Kenjū, from Bleach.

Currently the plan to obtain this is a rare drop from the Ender Dragon.

I do plan to implement the Shikai form at some point which would probably, for balance reasons, be activated with XP.
I'm thinking 5 levels initial cost and as it's active, drain xp. Rate of drain is still to be determined.
